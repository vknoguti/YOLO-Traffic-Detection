# YOLO-Traffic-Detection

This project utilizes the YOLO object detection model to detect vehicles, calculate their speeds, and count vehicles on highways.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time vehicle detection
- Vehicle speed calculation
- Vehicle count per lane
- Traffic flow analysis
- Traffic statistics generation

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- YOLOv11

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 💻 Usage

1. Navigate through and execute the cells according to your objective. There are markdown sections indicating which cells to execute based on the desired outcome (e.g., re-run from a specific configuration).

## 📊 Results

The system generates:

- Processed video with detections
- Vehicle count per lane
- Average vehicle speed data
- Traffic flow statistics

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **YOLOv11** for object detection
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **Python** as the primary programming language
